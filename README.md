# CrepuscularRays_PostProcess
Monogame port of http://xnauk-randomchaosblogarchive.blogspot.com/2012/07/crepuscular-god-rays-and-web-ui-sample.html

I tried to convert the sample from randomchaos to monogame /directx /windows desktop.
It's compiling and running, but you can see only a single coloured screen - the colours are changing when moving the cam xD
So, I'm not very experienced with deferred rendering and I hoped to get a simple introduction with this - but no...

Probably someone more experienced could lend me a hand and check what's going wrong here...

Cheers, Stephan
